There's an editing tool hosted online to help work with DDS content, https://www.piepieonline.com/ShadowsOfDoubt-DDSViewer/.

## Loading into Shadows of Doubt

Grab the latest release and install into SoD following the enclosed README. Delete the 'disabled.txt' files to enable the examples in your game.

## Getting Started

There are three examples included in the repo.

* Example_NewSpam
  * This example adds a brand new spam Vmail to the game, using an entirely custom tree (Subject line is 'Custom Spam!')
* Example_PatchedSpam
  * This example modifies the existing SyncDisk spam Vmail, adding an alternative subject line ('SYNCDISK UNIQUE OFFER' as well as the vanilla 'SYNCDISK OFFER SPECIAL')
* Example_IncidentalConvo
  * This example adds a new incidental conversation that can happen between NPCs when they pass each other, asking what day it is.

All of these are disabled by default, and can be enabled by deleting the disabled.txt file in the relevant folder.
