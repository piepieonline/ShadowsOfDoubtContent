# ShadowsOfDoubtContent

Additional, community generated, text content for Shadows Of Doubt.

## DDS Viewer Tool

There's a basic viewer tool hosted online to help work with DDS content, https://www.piepieonline.com/ShadowsOfDoubt-DDSViewer/. I'm hoping to expand this into more of an editor as time goes on. It also has a basic explainer of how the system works.

## Loading into Shadows of Doubt

Grab the latest release and install into SoD following the enclosed README.

## Getting Started

There are two examples included in the repo, both working on spam vmails for simplicity.

* Example_NewSpam
  * This example adds a brand new spam Vmail to the game, using an entirely custom tree (Subject line is 'Custom Spam!')
* Example_PatchedSpam
  * This example modifies the existing SyncDisk spam Vmail, adding an alternative subject line ('SYNCDISK UNIQUE OFFER' as well as the vanilla 'SYNCDISK OFFER SPECIAL')

Both of these are disabled by default, and can be enabled by deleting the disabled.txt file in the relevant folder.
